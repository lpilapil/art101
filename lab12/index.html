        <h1>Lab 12: Conditionals</h1>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>We did not have many challenges in completing this lab. I did have one issue where I forgot to link the Javascript to the HTML, but this was resolved after I looked through the code in depth and found that I did not input a script source.</p>
        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>There were no major problems that we encountered with the lab.</p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
