          <h1>Lab 9: Javascript for the Web</h1>
          <h2>Challenges</h2>
          <p>Some of the challenges I faced during this lab were in relation to adding the elements on the Javascript file. After looking through W3 to research the issues I was having, I was able to continue the lab and have my Javascript show up correctly in my index file.</p>
          <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>The only problems that I faced in my lab were about getting my Javascript file to function correctly. It was also problematic when I was trying to assign the different variables to the respective elements.</p>
          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>After researching, I was able to fix the code and it ran smoothly with no Syntax Errors.</p>
