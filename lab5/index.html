			<h2 id="title-challenges">Challenges</h2>
			<p>I had few challenges with this lab. One of the main challenges that I faced was writing down script correctly. I had written some of the script in my JS incorrectly, which made it fail to link with my index.HTML file. This goes to show the importance in making sure key script is spelling and spaced correctly. I was able to fix this issue when opening "console" in the inspector on Google Chrome.</p>

			<h2 id="title-problems">Problems</h2>
			<p>Some of the problems I encountered dealed with grammatical errors I made within my code. To be more specific, when coding the Output section of the JavaScript file, I wrote "document.writtenln", instead of "document.writeln". This broke my code and the Output section failed to load on my page. Once I discovered the problem, all of the information was displayed clearly on the webpage.</p>

			<h2 id="title-results">Results</h2>
			<p>This is the result of my index.HTML file. On the lab is the result of the final program execution for the html page.</p>
