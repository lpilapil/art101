          <h1>Lab 15: Ajax</h1>
          <h2>Challenges</h2>
          <p>There were many challenges during this lab. Understanding API's was difficult and I had to do further research to understand how they work. Another challenge I had was formatting the addEventListeners into the jQuery .ajax recipe. I found that it was really challenges to make sure all the () and {} were in the correct places.</p>
          <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>I ran into some syntax errors when adding the jQuery .ajax recipe into my Javascript. However, I kept going to the console on the web page and seeing exactly where the issues was coming from. The majority fo the issues came from syntax errors within the scipt.</p>
          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>When you click the teeny tiny putton below, the API for Pokemon's Pikachu should load:</p>
