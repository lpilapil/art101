			<h>Luke's Introduction</h>
	<main>

		<p>My name is Luke Pilapil and I am a senior currently studying Film and Digital Media at UCSC. I just moved to Santa Cruz in Septemeber from Portland, Oregon. I grew up in Los Angeles and have lived abroad. I love exploring new cities and spending time outside. In the future, I would love to live abroad again, possibly in a city such as Berlin or Amsterdam.</p>

		<!-- <p> My name is Sukhnoor Sahota. I'm a transfer student from the bay area so it's my first year at UCSC. I'm planning on moving to Santa Cruz in January. I'm excited to move because I love Santa Cruz and all it has to offer. I love nature, biking, painting, and just hanging out with friends. I'm excited for my first year at UCSC. -->
