      <h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>I had an issue involving the attatchment of the css file. I realized that I had spelled "stylesheet" incorrectly, which disconnected my css file from my index.html file.</p>
      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>I didn't run into any large problems during the course of the lab.</p>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>I wanted to make a loud and bright html file, so I used a larger font size.</p>

          <h2>Script Output</h2>
