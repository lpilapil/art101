          <h2>Challenges</h2>
          <p>I did not face many challenges when conducting this lab. It was slightly confusing to link the Javascript file at the beginning of the HTML file, since I usually only reference the CSS files when creating the HTML file.</p>
          <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>I found that both {},[], and () look very similar to one another, especially when working on a lengthy project. A couple of times, I mixed these up and this eventually broke the files. I wasn't sure what I did wrong, so I had to open the conosole and view the specific syntax error that was on that exact line of code. I also realized that when I created the CSS and JS files, I did not create a folder for each of these files. When I tried to link them in the heading of the HTML, I was linking them exactly how I have in previous labs. I didn't realize that I was missing these folders, so the JS and CSS were never linking properly. I have since corrected the extra writing on the HTML file and now it is properly working.</p>
          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>This is the results of the work performed during this lab.</p>
